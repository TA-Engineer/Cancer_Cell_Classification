# Cancer_Cell_Classification
In this project where I explored developing a Deep Learning model on HMT cancer cell image dataset along with Explainable AI algorithm such as GradCAM, GRADCAM++, SISE and RISE

The purpose of this project is to explore the learning of deep learning models that is considered blackbox by many in the industry. Explainable AI has come a long way in exploring the models with continous improvements in models such as GradCAM -> GradCAM++ -> GradCAM smooth.


How to view this repo:
HMT.ipynb notebook contains the project with some explanation. 
xai_utils.py contains the source code for some of the XAI algorithms which are imported in to the jupyter notebook.
However, GradCAM++ is coded inside the Jupyter notebook.
